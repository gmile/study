Todo:
 - Multiline comments!
 - Boolean result (?)
 - Rename 'variable' -> 'identifier'
 - Optimize table lookup:
   once fetched the whole table, filter out only minimal possible number of non-terminals,
   which can be used to describe a given string (sentance)
 - Cut out :commment items after parsing stage
 - A lot more (see pending tests)

Table:
 - Merge 'value' and 'value_fold'

Done:
 - '.' (dot) as reserved word for program end
